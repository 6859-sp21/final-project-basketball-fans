### commentary on project process
Before beginning work on this project, we spent a lot of time brainstorming with each other to come up with an interesting idea. We eventually arrived at the idea of visualizing basketball games. We collectively agreed that this was the direction we wished to pursue for our project, and we built a wire-frame of our vision for our project together. After this, we each claimed responsibility for parts of the project and worked on our own to complete it. During our development process, we held team meetings over zoom every couple days to discuss our progress on the project and how to move forward with completing it.
### division of work
As mentioned in the commentary project process, we took the time to work together on dividing this project up into a collection of tasks. These tasks included things like data collection and cleaning, scripting interactivity, and CSS design. From here, we assigned a priority value to each task, and we determined the required time investment to complete each individual task. At this point, we each claimed responsibility for a set of tasks so as to ensure a roughly-even distribution of total required time investment to complete the project. This division of labor afforded us the convience to work individually while also having a clear understanding of the specific tasks that each team member was pursuing.
